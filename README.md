Generative Text Models are AI models designed to generate human-like text based on input prompts. These models, such as GPT, leverage deep learning techniques like transformers to understand and produce coherent, contextually relevant sentences. This README covers the basics of generative text models, their applications, and how to implement them for tasks like content creation, chatbots, and more.
